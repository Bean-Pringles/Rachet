# Rachet
A compiler based programming langue 
To run:
Make a new .rachet file. I will being calling mine example.rachet
Input your rachet code.
Then run .\run.bat example.rachet
***The .\ specifies you trust the bat file so I would read it before you run***
***I am aware it is technically an interpretr right now so it will become a compiler in the future***
# Future Plans:
1. Compile not as a rust wrapper
2. Compile
